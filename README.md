# Tether

## Objective
An application built to bring players together, either within a community or a 1 on 1 
experience based off whatever game they interested in. Whether you want to make a 
post within a community or find someone active who wants to play now. Tether will 
get players connected.

## Context
Have you ever had a problem connecting with others within a single interest of a 
certain game but couldn't find a community that was on a single application? While 
applications such as discord can provide the ability to create a group centered 
around certain interests it's ability to reach out to others isn't as accessible as we 
think creating an exclusivity feeling. Among thousands if not hundreds-of-thousands 
of players within one community can make the feeling of connecting overwhelming, 
Tether tries to take that feeling and combat it with a algorithmic search to pair 
yourself up with others based of filters you have set or games you want a player 2 
for.

## Community
A community within tether is essentially a group built on a certain game, within the 
community is a collection of posts surrounding the game with pictures, gifs, 
requests, and general questions. Users can make posts (requests) to get other users
to join them. 


## Interacting & Connection
Get paired with someone instantly who's actively looking to play, with a random 
algorithm to pair people. Whether you want to search with filters such as a feature 
'play now' pairing anyone up who's ready to play instantly. Other features such as a 
region will be included to give the user to ability to pair with the right person.


## Users
User's will have rankings and reviews dependent on connecting with others and how 
they respond to others. Bad ratings = Bad player. A User within Tether will contain 
their own profile which contains their rating, reviews, profile picture, interests and a 
bio as well as basic information.
